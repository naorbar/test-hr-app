# test-hr-app
## Overview 
This is a project used for testing senior Java candidates<p>
## Follow the next steps carefully:
1. Import this project to your eclipse using maven
2. Build the project and run it on an application server, such as Tomcat (this is a spring WebMVC application)
3. The application is used to manage users (i.e. Human Resources app), and supports the following operations:
    1. Get all of the users
    2. Search for a given list of users
    3. Lookup for a specific user
    4. Add a new user
    5. Update an existing user
    6. Delete an existing user
4. Use any REST client such as Postman, to test the REST HrController's methods
5. There are several defects in this application (server side only): some are major design issues, some are programmatical/structural mistakes, and some are styling issues. 
    * please write down everything you suspect is a defect for later discussion 
    * please explain how one should treat each defect
6. Please fix everything you can to make this application: 
    * programmatically correct 
    * efficient
    * readable 
7. Implement a sort method based on the users ids; Which data structure is best used for this application (consider time and memory complexity)?
8. What is the biggest problem in this application (hint: design wise rather than programming wise)
9. What is dependency injection? HrManager is @autowired; why not using a static utility class instead? 
10. NNNN
    
**Goodluck** :+1:
